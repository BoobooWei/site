疫情期间宝宝的英语课转成了线上，虽然效果没有现场好，但这种特殊情况下，外教老师倒着时差给孩子上课也不容易～

英语和宝宝一起重新学习哈～ 复习单词，歌曲，对话

Thanks a lot to  the best parents and students  ￼
There was a great class today ￼￼ 
The new daily talk is excellent !! Kids speak very fluent and can give me answers for all my questions like “ When is your birthday 🎂 ?” “ What do you want for your birthday 🎁 ?”
I would like we push harder on reading 💪 
Reading is very important for the young generation 🤓📚
It helps kids get to know sounds , words and language ; 
expand their vocabulary , make a sentence ;
spark your child’s imagination ⭐️
Dear parents ,I would like to say “ Thank you “ to all of you , because of your hard working , practicing and reviewing the homework 📚 with kids ! Only in this way our kids can achieve great results in learning English ￼￼
I am really grateful for your help!
We appreciate your trust you have in us that you have selected our school among all for enrolling your child for a better education. We extend our thankful wishes to you and promise that we would work harder for a better development of your child.
Thank you all ￼
I am very happy being your teacher 👩🏼‍🏫 ￼

👏 Good job, 
my little stars ⭐️ 
You are learning very fast [OK]
Let’s push harder on our new daily talk 💪💪💪🤓📖
I would like, kids,  you make a project 🧐
A poster ( with pictures, drawings , paintings ) and describe what do you do in the morning [太阳][拥抱]
It will be nice 🌸I know how talented and smart you are [爱心]
Deadline: March 31  📆 
Also I would like we make English flexible [拥抱]
I completely agree with the meaning : “ Think over the box “ I would like my students act in this way 🤗
We don’t need to be concentrated on one sentence or word that we learnt , we can create new ones too [微笑]
Let’s be creators🙌🏼
For example we know the verb 
“ wash”
We know nouns 
-a head 
-hands 
-an apple 🍎 
-etc ...( a lot of nouns from previous topics ) 
And we can make new sentences , like :
-I wash my face in the morning [太阳]
-Please , wash an apple 🍏 
-I wash and comb  my head .
-Wash your hands before you eat [OK]
Thank you all ! 
You are  great 👍🏻 mhard workers !!
Keep it up [太阳][爱心]
