# Configure and Resolve Alerts[¶](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/alerts#configure-and-resolve-alerts)

Atlas issues alerts for the database and server conditions configured in your [alert settings](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/configure-alerts). When a condition triggers an alert, Atlas displays a warning symbol on the cluster and sends alert notifications. Your alert settings determine the notification methods. Atlas continues sending notifications at regular intervals until the condition resolves or you delete or disable the alert.
